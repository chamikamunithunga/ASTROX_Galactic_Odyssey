						</header><div class="content">
							<p>Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all bound together by gravity. The largest
								 contain trillions of stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can contain a few thousand stars
								  and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, some with billions
								   of times the Sun’s mass.Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances,
								    usually dubbed irregular.Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around 13.8 billionyears ago.
									 Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed approximately 500 million years ago. </p>
							<p>Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held together by their mutual gravity.
								 Larger structures, called clusters, may contain thousands of galaxies. Groups and clusters can be arranged
								  in superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound. Superclusters, empty voids, “walls” of galaxies, 
								  and other large-scale structures make up the cosmic web of matter in the universe.</p>

								<h3>Galactic Neighborhood: Our Milky Way's Cosmic Connection</h3>
								<p>From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge on.

									The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf galaxies (smaller galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbor.
									
									The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of the Laniakea supercluster.</p>

								<h3>Hubble eye in Milky</h3>
								<p>This Hubble Space Telescope image of a sparkling jewel box full of stars captures the heart of our Milky Way galaxy.

									Aging red giant stars coexist with their more plentiful younger cousins, the smaller, white, Sun-like stars, in this crowded region of our galaxy’s ancient central hub, or bulge. Most of the bright blue stars in the image are probably recently formed stars located in the foreground, in the galaxy's disk. Astronomers studied 10,000 of these Sun-like stars in archival Hubble images over a nine-year period to unearth clues to our galaxy’s evolution.</p>

								<h3>The Enigmatic Satellites of the Milky Way</h3>
								<p>Orbiting the Milky Way like cosmic companions, our galaxy is flanked by a handful of satellite galaxies. Among them, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud stand out as shimmering cosmic neighbors. These satellite galaxies, each with their unique charm and character, dance around the Milky Way, adding depth and dynamism to our galactic tapestry. Their gravitational waltz not only enriches the Milky Way's structure but also offers us a window into the evolutionary saga of our vast and star-studded home</p>
